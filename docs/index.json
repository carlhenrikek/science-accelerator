He has been working on machine learning models for over 20 years. He recently returned to academia after three years as Director of Machine Learning at Amazon. His main interest is the interaction of machine learning with the physical world. This interest was triggered by deploying machine learning in the African context, where ‘end-to-end’ solutions are normally required. This has inspired new research directions at the interface of machine learning and systems research, this work is funded by a Senior AI Fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute. Neil is also visiting Professor at the University of Sheffield and the co-host of Talking Machines.\n","date":1607687896,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1607687896,"objectID":"17a38ba4b0f1230b9b0b493908dff8f2","permalink":"http://carlhenrik.com/science-accelerator/author/neil-d.-lawrence/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/science-accelerator/author/neil-d.-lawrence/","section":"authors","summary":"Neil Lawrence is the inaugural DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge.
