She is also Director of the Data Trusts Initiative, a project tackling the actions needed to create trustworthy data governance frameworks.\nHer interests in AI and its consequences for science and society stem from her policy career, in which she worked with parliamentarians, leading researchers and civil society organisations to bring scientific evidence to bear on major policy issues. At the Royal Society, Jessica established and led a wide-ranging programme of policy development, public dialogue and international engagement that explored the frontiers of AI technologies and their implications for society. She worked with senior researchers, policymakers, civil society and industry to identify emerging policy needs and develop policy frameworks to enable safe and rapid deployment of these technologies. In her prior role as a Senior Clerk at the House of Commons, Jessica advised MPs on parliamentary procedure and practice. While advising a number of select committees – including Transport; Business, Innovation, and Skills; Regulatory Reform; and Science and Technology – Jessica managed inquiries into a range of science and policy issues, bringing evidence into the heart of political decision-making.\n","date":1607703226,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1607703226,"objectID":"f8885fa28f31756f147ee2f6cc2b1925","permalink":"http://carlhenrik.com/science-accelerator/author/jessica-montgomery/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/science-accelerator/author/jessica-montgomery/","section":"authors","summary":"Jessica is currently Executive Director of the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery, a new initiative developing AI tools and collaborations to tackle scientific challenges.

He has been working on machine learning models for over 20 years. He recently returned to academia after three years as Director of Machine Learning at Amazon. His main interest is the interaction of machine learning with the physical world. This interest was triggered by deploying machine learning in the African context, where ‘end-to-end’ solutions are normally required. This has inspired new research directions at the interface of machine learning and systems research, this work is funded by a Senior AI Fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute.
